## Summary

See if you can get a perfect 12! This game is meant to test your short-term memory, you begin by clicking on a FIFA player card, after each click the cards will randomly change places, the goal is to click a new card each time. If you click on a card you've already clicked on, you lose!

This is my first React homework. It uses vanilla React, no react-router, no hooks, no context, just straight up React (with some react-bootstrap sprinkled in).

### Technologies Used: 
* React
* JavaScript

### Theme 

2019 FIFA FIFPro World XI (honorary mention - Dusan Tadic - to complete the 12 cards)
